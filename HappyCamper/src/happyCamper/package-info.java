* <br><u>How to run:</u>
* <br>	With GUI: Happy Camper should be run from the HappyCamperView class in order to interract with the GUI.
* <br>	Without GUI: Functionality without the GUI should be tested from the PersonalizedResult class.
* <br>	Testing Classes: Most classes are set up with their own commented-out main method for individual class testing.
* <br>	
* <br>	There are 3 file paths which need to be adjusted to the user's specific file-path. They are located in the classes:
* <br>		- Weather
* <br>		- Campsite
* <br>		- ZipCodeDatabase
* <br>
* <br><u>About the data and results:</u>
* <br>	!!DATE RANGE: Must be between 06/01/20 and 06/08/20!!
* <br>	User's initial zip code should be a New York state zip code.
* <br>	Not all dates have good weather. The weather on 06/01/20 and 06/02/20 is particularly cold and rainy.
* <br>	More campsites available at ranges over 100 miles from NYC.
* <br>
* <br><u>Realism Note:</u>
* <br>	Some campsite names associated with multiple zip codes due to the way we combined our datasets. 
* <br>	This issue would not be present with more accurate datasets.
